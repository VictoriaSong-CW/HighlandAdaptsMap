# Highland Adapts Climate Vulnerability and Adaptability Webmap
## Victoria Song | 20/06/2025
### This repository contains the R script and a html of the webmap hosted via AWS3.

### Link to html: http://highland-adapts-climate-webmap.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/
#### Please note the webmap file is large (~4GB) so it will take a few minutes to load. Recommended to leave the page running independently (with no other open browsers/tabs).

### To embed this in the website, paste this in the html:
<iframe 
  src="http://highland-adapts-climate-webmap.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/"
  width="100%" 
  height="600" 
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

#### Things to look into post-project with Harper:
#### Loading the webpage takes a long time so there might be better alternative options e.g. CloudFlare.
